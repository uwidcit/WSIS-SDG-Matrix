    "WSIS_MATRIX_INFO": "At the WSIS Forum 2015, ITU coordinated the WSIS Action Lines and SDG matrix with the UN Action Line Facilitators. This is a new tool developed by a number of United Nations agencies based on their expertise and mandate to map how ICTs may contribute to the implementation of the new SDGs. The Matrix serves as an easy reference for stakeholders engaged in shaping the future of both, the SDGs and the WSIS processes beyond 2015 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ICTs are identified as targets in the SDGs for education, gender equality, infrastructure (universal and affordable access to the internet) and in the implementation goal as a cross cutting tool to be utilized for the achievement of all of the SDGs. The effective implementation of the WSIS Action Lines can help accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. To that end, the WSIS SDGs Matrix, developed by the UN Action line Facilitators, clearly shows the linkage between each Action line and the 17 SDGs and provides rationale for each.",
